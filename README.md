# Rome-Improvements
Buffs Rome w/out making it op. Rome was one of the worst designed civs in V imo; it had no playstyle and it's Uniques were inconsequential.  Specific buffs &amp; reasoning can be found here :)

> UA: Ontop of their vanilla bonus production towards buildings present the Capital, they gain +25% produce millitary land units in ANNEXED cities, and pay -50% road maintinence.
> LEGION: Gains the Cover I & Great Generals I promotion (+33 Defense vs Ranged attacks & combat contributes 50% more towards creating GGs). To balance this out they cost an extra +10 production (85 vs 75).
> BALLISTA: Doesn't have to set up to attack. In exchange, it bonus vs cities is decreased to 2.5x damage from 3x. (Thus the new Ballista does 25 base damage, the OG Ballista does 30, and the Catapult does 24; of course not having to set up means the new Ballista gets more shots off on average.
> Other Changes: Preferred Victory type changed from Science to Domination. (This essentially makes Rome more agressive than average, & makes them spend an average amount of production on science and an above average on Units.)



> Why is Rome bad? (Allegedly)

> I don't believe Rome in Civ V to be a particularly "underpowered/weak" civ; overall I'd rank them as most people seem to, as thoroughly "Meh". Below average, but not as weak as Venice, about in the 40th percentile. But I'd consider Rome worse design-wise because Venice does what a civ is meant to do: present a set of bonuses to the player that benefits & encourages a specific method of playing, thus making the game playing as Venice and as a whole more interesting. Rome's uniques are insubstantial, thus don't really encourage anything but kinda wide play? I presume the dev's intended to make them a civ focused around Classical-era millitary expansion but since their UU's are replacements for units that are outclassed in that era, they're insubstantial and thus offer no real advantage. Thus you're basically left with a civ that has a consistent but highly trivial & generic bonus and that's it. I get a feeling not many people would ever choose to play Rome fit it wasn't, y'know, Rome. And no I'm not a Romeaboo, good guess tho; I just feel like Rome could do a little better than a Hard 4, barely above generic.
